# Keisei Sai

Mathematics undergraduate at Tokyo University of Science  
Interested in optimization, numerical computation, and software engineering.

## Current Focus
- Optimization on manifolds
- Algorithmic problem solving (LeetCode / AtCoder)
- Preparing for Software Engineering internships

## Featured Projects
- **Geometric Optimization on Manifolds**  
  Manifold-aware gradient descent with numerical experiments and visualizations:  
  `github.com/Keisei-Sai/manifold-optimization`

- **Algorithm Practice**  
  Interview-style problems with clean implementations and complexity notes:  
  `github.com/Keisei-Sai/algorithm-practice`

## Background
I enjoy translating mathematical ideas into practical algorithms and implementations.
